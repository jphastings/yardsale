      <p><strong>Hello.</strong> I'm JP.</p>

      <p>I'm moving house soon and there's some stuff that doesn't need to move with me, so I'm having a <strong>Yard Sale</strong>.</p>

      <p>But this is <strong>London</strong>, I don't have a yard, I have a laptop. So I'm adding photos of my things on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yardsalebyjp/">instagram</a> as I pack instead.</p>

      <p>If there's anything you'd like then just email me, <a href="mailto:yardsale@byjp.me">yardsale@byjp.me</a>, with details of what it is and anything you'd like to offer in return.</p>

      <p>I'll accept money, hugs, drinks, stories and probably just about anything else including the promise to just take the thing off my hands.</p>

      <p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/yardsalebyjp/">Yard Sale by JP</a> on Instagram</p>
